Database report:


Background:
In the project specification I was required to create a database using mySQL commands. I understand the basics of MySQl and acquired knowledge on the database schema. My mentor proposed a few questions for me to answer at the end of Phase 2.  I'd like a chance to answer each of them

Question 1: 
We have the names of the fields we can store in addition to the types of those fields.

Question 2:
