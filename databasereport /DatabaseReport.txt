Database report:


Background:
In the project specification I was required to create a database using mySQL commands. I understand the basics of MySQl and acquired knowledge on the database schema. My mentor proposed a few questions for me to answer at the end of Phase 2.  I'd like a chance to answer each of them

Question 1: 
We have the names of the fields we can store in addition to the types of those fields. 

What are the data types for title, body and date for every post?

Answer 1 :
The title, body and date was created in the create table post command.

Title will be a string variable data type. The reason is because for title we want to hold
multiple characters. 

Body will be a string variable data time. Same reason as title because for body we want to
hold multiple characters. 

Submission date will be a timestamp datatype. The reason is because of the specificity of timestamp. We want our values to contain both date and time parts. 

Question 2: 

Why do you think we asked you to have an id column in your schema? What do you think the id be used for later in the project?

Attaching an ID to each post. We can quickly search and identify the posts through the SQL storage and we can quickly retrieve posts O(1). The id's are essential for when we have the mobile app built. For instance, the database will house all of the information to an user and the mobile client will communicate to the same database that the web application is communicating to. So, if a user is creating a new post on the mobile client my database will update the bulletin board and send the updated table to the web application.
