/*
This page will link to TicketIndex.php 
The tricky part is that this will be an unifying system in its own right. 
I will based this system on an unique ID that is assigned to each seller
of the mobile app and website. So ever time a buyer clicks a link in TicketIndex.php the unique id in mysql
will play a role in launching a new and dynamic webpage for the buyer to discover more information on the seller
according to the live event ticket that the buyer would like to purchase.

Need time to code. Hopefully will get it to 7/30 and I plan to stay in the GT library and code this all weekend
