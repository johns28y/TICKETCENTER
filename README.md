# bulletinboard
bulletinboard enables users to post messages, see a list of all of the messages that were previously posted, and read individual messages. 

Synopsis:
This repository is storage for a half-summer project that was assigned by a special friend and mentor.

Code:

The project is divvy up via phases. The overall goal is to build a bulletin board from end to end. 

There were several crucial required for completion: 

a) database to store users' post. MySQL commands were written to intialize this database. Code available inside.

b) website mockup designs. Written in HTML. Code available inside. 

c) iOS app. Code will be available later.

Motivation:
Georgia Tech will hit me hard if I do not develop the abilities to complete projects. A special friend and mentor wanted to help me strenghten my engineering abilities. So, he developed this project for me.
